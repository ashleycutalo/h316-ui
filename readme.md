## H316 Kitchen Computer Evolved - UI

UI for menu planning and recipe management in my household.

## What's with the name?

H316 comes from the Honeywell 316 Kitchen Computer, one of the first computers ever envisioned to be a consumer product. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_316 for more history info.

## What is the rationale behind this project?

This project was created to solve a real world problem (as the primary cook and grocery shopper having to constantly ask others what they want to eat the next week); however, it is mainly a sandbox for me to explore and learn new frameworks and technologies in my spare time as a hobby. As such, this project will be constantly evolving and receiving new features, even if they are overly complex for such a simple idea.
